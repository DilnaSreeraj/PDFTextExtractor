Hamel had said| that he would question us on participles, and I did not| know the first word about them. For a moment I thought of| running away and spending the day out of doors. It was so| warm, so bright! The birds were chirping at the edge of the| woods; and in the open field back of the sawmill the| Prussian soldiers were drilling. It was all much more| tempting than the rule for participles, but I had the| strength to resist, and hurried off to school.| When I passed the town hall there was a crowd in| front of the bulletin-board. For the last two years all our| bad news had come from there \u2014 the lost battles, the draft,| the orders of the commanding officer \u2014 and I thought to| myself, without stopping, \u201cWhat can be the matter now?\u201d|", "", "<h3>11111|", "", "<s7>2020-21|", "", "<h2>\u00a9  NCERT | not to be republished|", "", "<s4>The Last Lesson", "<s7>/3|", "", "<p>Then, as I hurried by as fast as I could go, the| blacksmith, Wachter, who was there, with his apprentice,| reading the bulletin, called after me, \u201cDon\u2019t go so fast,| bub; you\u2019ll get to your school in plenty of time!\u201d| I thought he was making fun of me, and reached| M. Hamel\u2019s little garden all out of breath.| Usually, when school began, there was a great bustle,| which could be heard out in the street, the opening and| closing of desks, lessons repeated in unison, very loud, with| our hands over our ears to understand better, and the| teacher\u2019s great ruler rapping on the table. But now it was| all so still! I had counted on the commotion to get to my| desk without being seen; but, of course, that day everything| had to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the window| I saw my classmates, already in their places, and M. Hamel| walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his| arm. I had to open the door and go in before everybody.

Everybody looked| sad; and Hauser had brought an old primer, thumbed at| the edges, and he held it open on his knees with his great| spectacles lying across the pages.| While I was wondering about it all, M. Hamel mounted| his chair, and, in the same grave and gentle tone which he| had used to me, said, \u201cMy children, this is the last lesson| I shall give you. The order has come from Berlin to teach| only German in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. The| new master comes tomorrow. This is your last French| lesson. I want you to be very attentive.\u201d| What a thunderclap these words were to me!| Oh, the wretches; that was what they had put up at| the town-hall!| My last French lesson! Why, I hardly knew how to| write! I should never learn any more!

My books, that had| seemed such a nuisance a while ago, so heavy to carry, my| grammar, and my history of the saints, were old friends now| that I couldn\u2019t give up. And M.

That day M.| Hamel had new copies for us,| written in a beautiful round hand| \u2014 France, Alsace, France, Alsace.
